##### About this post

To share my experience in how I have put CSS GRID to use in my portfolio site. It is not about Flexbox Vs CSS Grid.

I would love to say flex + grid = awesome easy layoutting !!!

##### Target Audience

People who are currently using and know only `flexbox, positions, float` is the way for layouting.

> People new to CSS I would highly recommend to go through different layouting approaches (`flexbox, positions, float`)

###### What is written everywhere, while I have started to read about

* Flexbox - 1-Dimensional layout
* CSS Grid - 2-Dimensional layout

what the fuck is it ... I really don't understand by it ... If you ever felt it, then continue reading !!!

If you ever worked with flexbox you might have seen using `flex-direction` which takes values as `row` or `column`, defaults to `row` if not specified
